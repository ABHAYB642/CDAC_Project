              <b>STEP 1</b>
              <br />
              Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Oil and line the base of two
              18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate
              of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.
              <br />
              <b>STEP 2</b>
              <br />
              Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs,
              sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until
              smooth.
              <br />
              <b>STEP 3</b>
              <br />
              Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until
              risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for
              10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.
              <br />
              <b>STEP 4</b>
              <br />
              To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft.
              Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then
              add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.
              <br />
              <b>STEP 5</b>
              <br />
              Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover
              the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.
